# unit-4-game

* Each character in the game has 3 attributes: Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power.

* Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power.

* The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power.

* The Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power of each character are unique.

* No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points.

A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low Counter Attack Power. 
This will allow them to grind Attack Power and to take on enemies before they lose all of their Health Points.
